Happiness Dashboard Analysis
Objective:

The purpose of this project is to analyze global happiness data across multiple countries and regions from 2015 to 2019. The main objective is to identify the factors affecting happiness, evaluate economic impacts, and visualize happiness trends using interactive dashboards.

EDA:

1)Collected and cleaned happiness data across 166 countries and 11 regions from 2015–2019.

2)Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study how factors like GDP, family, freedom, trust, health and generosity contribute to the happiness of a country.

3)Built an interactive dashboard to display:

Top 10 happiest countries by score.

Yearly changes in the most and least happy countries.

Comparison of economy (GDP per capita) with happiness.

Regional distribution of happiness and GDP.

Factors contributing to happiness over the years.

Happiness Trends:

The global average happiness score across years was around 5.38 on a scale of 2.69–7.77.

Denmark consistently ranked among the happiest countries, with a score of 7.55 in 2019, while Burundi had one of the lowest with 3.08.

Factors Influencing Happiness: Variables such as GDP per capita, social support, freedom, and health had strong positive correlations with happiness.

Regional Differences:

Western and Central/Eastern Europe showed the highest happiness scores.

Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia scored the lowest in both economic indicators and happiness.

Economy vs. Happiness: A positive but not linear correlation existed between GDP per capita and happiness, suggesting non-economic factors play a key role.

Conclusion
Wealthier nations generally report higher happiness levels, but GDP alone does not fully explain happiness variations.

Social support, freedom, and healthy life expectancy significantly enhance happiness beyond mere economic strength.

Regional inequalities persist, with Europe consistently outperforming Africa and South Asia.

Interactive dashboards allow policymakers and researchers to track trends over time and derive actionable insights for improving societal well-being.
